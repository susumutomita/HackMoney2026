# Pitch Deck (Marp)

This folder contains a Marp-compatible slide deck.

## Files

- `PITCH.md` — Marp slide deck source

## How to export

If you have Marp installed:

```bash
npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest docs/pitch/PITCH.md --pdf --allow-local-files
# or
npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest docs/pitch/PITCH.md --pptx --allow-local-files
```

If you don’t want to install anything, you can copy-paste `PITCH.md` into the Marp web editor.
