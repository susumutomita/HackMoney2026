# ZeroKey Treasury

**Firewall for AI Agent Payments**

Check first. Then pay.

---

## Problem

- AI agents can spend money
- No one checks before they pay
- Bad provider? Money is gone
- Over budget? Too late

---

## Solution

- ZeroKey checks every payment
- Safe? --> Pay
- Not safe? --> Block
- Money does not move without approval

---

## How It Works

- Agent finds a provider
- AI checks if it is safe
- Approve or block
- Pay with USDC (cross-chain)

---

## Demo

**https://zerokey.exe.xyz:8000**

- Pick a provider
- Firewall checks it
- USDC payment
- Base --> Arc Testnet
- All logs on-chain

---

## Tech Stack

- Solidity + Foundry (Safe Guard)
- Hono + TypeScript + Claude API
- Next.js 15 + React 19
- USDC + Circle Gateway
- ENS
- Base Sepolia, Arc Testnet
